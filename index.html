<p style="text-align: justify">
Navigate the Github page to understand the concept of the project and use Github folder to check out the code (comming soon) and test it. The code will not be ready to run, you will need to obtain your data to run the program. The objective of this project is to develop an unsupervised machine learning technique
to detect abnormal brain images from a dataset of images using least amount of preprocessing
and computation. For group neuroimaging studies involving thousands of
brain images, it is important to carefully identify and inspect such brain images before
including them in the study. Typically, physicians/researchers examine the images
manually to identify abnormalities, which is a tedious and laborious task for a large
number of scans. Methods for efficient and accurate automation of this process are
lacking and are necessary. We proposed a method based on recursive nearest
agglomerative clustering in a population, we assume that the abnormal regions of the
brain differ from patient to patient. Therefore, the summary of all brain images can
reflect the healthy brain structure. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images of 100 patients with traumatic brain
injuries (TBI) from the tracktbi pilot dataset [6]</p>
<h1 id="recursive-nearest-agglomeration" style="text-align: center">- Recursive Nearest Agglomeration -</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify">Recursive nearest agglomeration (ReNA) is a fast hierarchical clustering algo-
rithm for approximating data that contains structure[2]. ReNA fundamentally re-
lies on feature grouping and nearest neighborhood graphs. For high-dimensional
datasets, feature grouping is widely used in the feld of signal processing, pat-
tern recognition, and computer vision for data approximation and feature selection [4]. In addition, applying feature grouping to high-dimensional data is a useful tool for reducing the complexity of computation and improving the stability of feature selection [3]. To apply dimensional reduction via feature grouping,
we design a feature grouping matrix <script type="math/tex">\phi_{FG} \in R^{kxp}</script> where <script type="math/tex">k</script> corresponds to the number of clusters and p is the number of features/voxels. To obtain the re-
duced version of sample/image <script type="math/tex">x_{i} \in R^{p}; i = 1, ..., n</script> we use equation 1 and for
    reconstructed version of the sample/image xi, we use equation 2.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
ReNA uses nearest neighborhood graphs to design the feature grouping matrix <script type="math/tex">\phi_{FG}</script> that projects data into lower dimensional space. <script type="math/tex">\alpha</script> -nearest neighbor graphs
tend to percolate for <script type="math/tex">\alpha \geq 2</script>, therefore ReNA algorithm applies first nearest
neighbor graphs recursively until the desired number of clusters is reached [3].
Overall ReNA has two stages. First, it starts by initializing the number of clusters
k equal to the number of features/voxels p similar to a bottom-up approach in
clustering. In addition to initial clusters, it denes an adjacent sparse matrix <script type="math/tex">G \in \{0,1\}^{pxp}</script> for the graph g ,e.g., the topological structure of 3D MRI. The second stage applies the nearest neighborhood graphs to build a similarity graph
that encodes affnity between features. Then, it recursively updates the clusters until reaching the desired number of clusters k. To summarize, ReNA performs four steps repeatably to compute the clusters of features: (1) graph the representation <strong>X</strong> data matrix that is 2D or 3D of MRI image and <strong>G</strong> matrix that encode the associated connectivity of matrix <strong>X</strong>. (2) fnding first nearest neigbors via a distance metric (3) computing the clusters (4) reduction of graph and topology. The important key point of ReNA is that it is fast while avoiding percolation and designed for data that follow a specific
structure.</p>
        
<h1 id="approach" style="text-align: center">- Approach -</h1>
<h2 id="data-preprocessing" style="text-align: center">Data Preprocessing</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">Figure 2 shows the method workflow of our approach. We used T1-weighted, T2-
weighted, and FLAIR MRI sequences for each subject, which were pre-processed by
performing skull removal using BrainSuite [3] followed by alignment to MNI atlas. Each
image was then resampled to a shared space of 91x109x91 with 2mm isotropic voxels
using Nilearn: Machine Learning for Neuro-Imaging in Python software [1]. After
transforming to 1D, each image is represented by an array of 270806 voxels. We
concatenate these arrays that result in 3N x 270806, where N is the number of subjects
and the number of images per subject is three since we use T1, T2, and FLAIR images.</p>

<h2 id="methods" style="text-align: center">Methods</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">After applying the preprocessing on the dataset, we then implement the ReNA
algorithm, which defines a projection to a space of 54160 voxels (approximately 20% of
the original images). Each image is reconstructed back to the original space of 270806
voxels. We compute the mean squared error (MSE) between the original images and
the reconstructed images across voxels. Finally, we use the average of these MSEs
across T1, T2, and FLAIR images per subject as a metric to quantify and examine
abnormality of the brain images.</p>

<h1 id="results" style="text-align: center">- Results -</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify">We plot averaged MSE across three modalities for each subject in descending order (Fig 3). After examining these MSEs, it was found that the subjects with the highest MSE had large ventricles, hemorrhages and lesions in their brains. On the other hand,
subjects with the smallest MSEs have been found to have healthier brains (Fig. 3). Note that these analyses are handled within a few minutes (less than 1 minute of ReNA execution, 5 minute total) on a standard computer that shows the computational efficiency of the approach.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion" style="text-align: center">- Conclusion -</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify">We proposed a fast unsupervised approach to detect abnormalities in brain images
using a fast dimensionality reduction technique based on feature grouping. The
method can be run on the original scan with least amount of preprocessing. Our
results demonstrate the computational efficiency and light system requirements for
the proposed approach. We will make this tool available as an open source software
and envision that large population studies would incorporate this as a standard
screening tool to identify outlier subjects.</p>
